Abstract

The project “Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews” was aimed at analyzing customer sentiment expressed in Amazon reviews using machine learning techniques. A diverse dataset of Amazon reviews across various product categories was collected, and thorough preprocessing and cleaning were performed to prepare the data for analysis. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, a sentiment analysis model was developed to automatically classify the sentiment of the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiment of the reviews was accurately predicted for approximately 62.5% and 87% of the reviews by the logistic regression model and DistillBert model, respectively, achieving accuracy scores of 0.625 and 0.87. Valuable insights into customer sentiment were provided by the project, with positive and negative sentiment trends being identified, and correlations between sentiment and various review attributes being uncovered. Future work includes the improvement of the model’s accuracy, the expansion of analysis to other e-commerce platforms, the incorporation of aspect-based sentiment analysis, the implementation of real-time sentiment monitoring, and the integration of sentiment insights into business decision-making processes.
